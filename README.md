# FiredrakeNDV
This repository contains code scripts for the numerical solution of various linear and nonlinear nondivergence form PDEs.

The code scripts are implementable in the latest version of Firedrake, available here: https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html

The folder "Meshes" contains the meshes that are called in the code scripts. They have been generated in Gmsh: http://gmsh.info/
